Array is a linear data structure and memory are reserved continuously but linked list is not.
Arraylist Store items continuously.

  Fixed size arrays and pre allocated memory.
  Insertion / deletion in the beginning is costly.
  Implementation of Stack and queue is difficult as insertion / deltion.


Linked List
-----------
NO need for contiguous memory allocation.
No need to prereserve space.
Insertion and deletion can happen in the middle and not costly.
Self Referential data structure

Traversing a linked list
------------------------
Time Complexity is O(n)

1. Print using While Loop ->  O(n)
2. Print using Iteration  ->  O(n)
3. Insert at the beginning => Time Complexisty is O(1)
4. Insert at the End => Traverse to the end and then add the node => O(n)
